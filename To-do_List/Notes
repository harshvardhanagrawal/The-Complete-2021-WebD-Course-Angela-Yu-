EJS files are used to create html templates for HTML

Format is normal html syntax. 

Use <% attrbtes to insert JavaScript code.

Variables can also be defined in an EJS file using <%=, thus eliminating the need to create seperate html files for each possible case. (we are talking about backend scipting here)
These variables can be sent values using render() function. The values are passed in the form of a JSON object.

All the ejs files should be created in a views directory.
